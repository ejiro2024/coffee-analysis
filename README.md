# Coffee-analysis

# Introduction
In the highly competitive coffee industry, understanding customer purchase behaviors is crucial for optimizing sales and improving business operations. This project aims to analyze transaction data from three coffee shop locations in New York City to identify key patterns, trends, and opportunities. By transforming raw sales data into an interactive dashboard, franchise owners will gain valuable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Data Source
The dataset for this analysis is obtained from a CSV file stored in Google Drive. It contains detailed transaction records, including:
-	Transaction details (ID, date, time, quantity)
-	Store information (ID, location)
-	Product details (ID, price, category, type, and specific item description)
This structured dataset will serve as the foundation for data profiling, transformation, and visualization.
